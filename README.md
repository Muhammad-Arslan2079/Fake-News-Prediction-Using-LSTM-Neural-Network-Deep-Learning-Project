# üì∞ Fake News Prediction Using LSTM Neural Network

This project implements a deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict fake news based on textual input. It uses a Kaggle dataset combining headlines and article bodies, and applies NLP techniques to clean and preprocess the data before feeding it into an LSTM network.

##  Overview

Fake news poses a serious challenge to media and information credibility. This project uses a natural language processing (NLP) approach with LSTM-based deep learning to classify news as real or fake based on its content.

Key components:

* Text preprocessing using NLTK
* Tokenization and padding
* Sequential model using Keras LSTM
* Binary classification



##  Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Fake News Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jruvika/fake-news-detection)
* The dataset contains:

  * `Headline`
  * `Body`
  * `Label` (1 = Fake, 0 = Real)  Assuming this,since I have no information about labels categories as they were already encoded,so I am assuming it as 1=Fake and 0=Authentic, you can change it later on as per you  dataset labels.
* Combined features `Headline` and `Body` into a single `Text` field.
